# Genetic-Algorithm-Project

In this project we will be maximizing the critical buckling load of a channel column made out of homogeneous material (steel) by putting notches to the structure. 
To do that we used Genetic-Algorithm. Divided the crossection into small elements with nodes placed equidistantly. The nodes can have values of '1' or '0'. 
'0' represents that the node is not actively participating in the node, and '1' represents that the node is participating in node formation. So, the entire crossection can be represented with binary strings that explain where the notches are and how long they are. 

Ex:
0001000 represents 
___/\___
